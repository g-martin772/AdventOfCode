# Advent of Code 

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! ðŸŒŸ In this collection, I embark on a thrilling journey to solve the Advent of Code puzzles using a different coding language each day. This repository showcases the versatility of various programming languages, turning the festive season into a coding celebration.

## Table of Contents

- [Languages Used](#languages-used)
- [Folder Structure](#folder-structure)
- [How to Navigate](#how-to-navigate)

## Languages Used

Diversity is not just a buzzword; it's a principle that guides this repository. Here are some of the languages I've employed so far:

- Python
- JavaScript
- Java
- Ruby
- Go
- C++
- Php
- Rust
- Kotlin
- TypeScript
- and many more!

## Folder Structure

Organized by day, each folder contains solutions implemented in a specific language. The structure looks like this:

```markdown
/
|-- [year]/
|   |-- info.md
|   |-- day[x]-part1
|   |-- day[x]-part2
|   |-- ...
|-- ...
```

Feel free to explore and learn from the solutions. Compare approaches in different languages to broaden your coding horizons.

## How to Navigate

- **Browse by Day**: Each day's folder houses solutions in various languages. Dive into a specific day to explore different solutions.
- **Search**: Use GitHub's search feature to find specific solutions, languages, or coding patterns throughout the repository.

*Advent of Code* is not just about solving puzzles; it's a unique platform that combines creativity, problem-solving, and coding expertise. The challenges are designed to be both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, making December a month to look forward to for coders worldwide.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this repository serves as an excellent resource for learning new languages, refining your skills, and appreciating the beauty of diverse coding solutions (at least i hope so, if you find any issues please contact me xD).

Let the coding festivities begin! ðŸŽ„ðŸš€
